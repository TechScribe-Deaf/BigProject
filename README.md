# BigProject Template
This project template is more or less a good starting point for you to write a C program. There are few customizations such as doxygen-awesome-css themes, helper scripts, useful dependencies, and more! You can use this template for a professional project as well if desired to. The BigProject template and Doxygen-awesome-css projects are licensed under MIT License at this time of writing 11/15/2022.

This template project is used for the book called, "Introduction to C Programming Language" by TechScribe which is free for anyone to read: https://github.com/TechScribe-Deaf/Docs/blob/main/IntroToCLanguage.pdf
